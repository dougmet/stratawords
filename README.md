# Strata Talks Word Analysis

Analysis of the key words in the title and descriptions of Strata-Hadoop talks 2012-2016. Topics will be filled in as they're done.

## Data

The data is taken from the Strata schedules for London from 2012-2016. This might be increased to worldwide but at the moment it's a little more manual than I'd like acquiring the data so it'll be slow.

## Analysis

### Apache <insert name>

Strata's a good way to track which Apache projects are being talked about. The initial analysis finds all of the instances of Apache <something> for each of the years. We then turn to how they are connected by forming the co-mention network of Apache projects.
